Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay. Clear examples of boundaries of processes are almost always of the fiat sort (midnight, a time of death as declared in an operating theater or on a death certificate, the initiation of a state of war)" xsd:string

Since rates may change, and since such changes, too, may have rates of change, we have to deal here with a hierarchy of process profile universals at successive levels; One important sub-family of rate process profiles is illustrated by the beat or frequency profiles of cyclical processes, illustrated by the 60 beats per minute beating process of John’s heart, or the 120 beats per minute drumming process involved in one of John’s performances in a rock band, and so on. Each such process includes what we shall call a beat process profile instance as part, a subtype of rate process profile in which the salient ratio is not distance covered but rather number of beat cycles per unit of time. Each beat process profile instance instantiates the determinable universal beat process profile. But it also instantiates multiple more specialized universals at lower levels of generality, selected from rate process profilebeat process profileregular beat process profile3 bpm beat process profile4 bpm beat process profileirregular beat process profileincreasing beat process profileand so on.In the case of a regular beat process profile, a rate can be assigned in the simplest possible fashion by dividing the number of cycles by the length of the temporal region occupied by the beating process profile as a whole. Irregular process profiles of this sort, for example as identified in the clinic, or in the readings on an aircraft instrument panel, are often of diagnostic significance.; The simplest type of process profiles are what we shall call ‘quality process profiles’, which are the process profiles which serve as the foci of the sort of selective abstraction that is involved when measurements are made of changes in single qualities, as illustrated, for example, by process profiles of mass, temperature, aortic pressure, and so on." xsd:string

comment: The term body of water most often refers to large accumulations of water, such as oceans, seas, and lakes, but it includes smaller pools of water such as ponds, wetlands, or more rarely, puddles. A body of water does not have to be still or contained; Rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are also considered bodies of water.

comment: The definitions of forest can vary greatly, and different classes will be needed to support the major categories. Tree cover alone is not enough to distinguish between forests and plantations. The international definition proposed by the 2010 FAO Forestry Resource Assessment: "land spanning more than 0.5 ha with trees higher than 5 metres and canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ . It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use." - FAO.  2010. Global forest resources assessment 2010, Main report, FAO Forestry Paper 163. Rome.

The exact definition of a mineral is under debate, especially with respect to the requirement a valid species be abiogenic, and to a lesser extent with regards to it having an ordered atomic structure.

comment: 'In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the 'solid geology'. Soil is commonly referred to as "earth" or "dirt"; technically, the term "dirt" should be restricted to displaced soil.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil\n\n" The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.\n\nThe lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm."

comment: Everything under this parent must be a mass noun (i.e. not countable). All subclasses are to be understood as being composed primarily of the named entity, rather than restricted to that entity. For example, "ENVO:water" is to be understood as "environmental material composed primarly of some CHEBI:water".
comment: Instances of this class are portions of environmental materials, such as seawater in bucket, a water parcel in the photic zone of a lake, or the concrete that composes a building part. Instances of these portions may have fiat or non-fiat boundaries. For example, a water parcel has not physical boundaries, while the seawater in a bucket is bounded by the internal surfaces of the bucket.

comment: This class is distinct from a geometric surface, which is two-dimensional. The idea of "uppermost" may be problematic. Further, the definition of layer (the superclass of surface in rev 133) references surface. This may be another issue. Perhaps this can be made into an inferred class using 'bounding layer of' some material entity, note that 'bounding layer' implies containment, which may not be valid here.

comment: Ocean biomes are determined by major bodies of saline water, principal components of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface is covered by ocean, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) deep. Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt.

def: "A subtropical condition is an environmental condition in which an envrionmental system receives more solar irradiance than those with temperate conditions, but less than those with tropical conditions. At low elevations, this typically results in eight months of the year having average temperatures greater than or equal to 10 degrees Celsius with the coldest monthly temperature averaging between 2 and 13 degrees Celsius." []
comment: As with most other climatic zones and conditions, multiple classification schemes have somehat different definitions and criteria. To quote from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ "Several methods have been used to define the subtropical climate. In the Trewartha climate classification, a subtropical region should have at least eight months with a mean temperature of 10 °C (50.0 °F) or above. German climatologists Carl Troll and Karlheinz Paffen defined Warm temperate zones as plain and hilly lands having an average temperature of the coldest month between 2 °C (35.6 °F) and 13 °C (55.4 °F) in the Northern Hemisphere and between 6 °C (42.8 °F) and 13 °C (55.4 °F) in the Southern Hemisphere, excluding oceanic and continental climates. According to the Troll-Paffen climate classification, there generally exists one large subtropical zone named the warm-temperate subtropical zone,[4] which is subdivided into seven smaller areas.[5]\n\nAccording to the E. Neef climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into two parts: Rainy winters of the west sides and Eastern subtropical climate.[6] According to the Wilhelm Lauer & Peter Frankenberg climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into three parts: high-continental, continental, and maritime.[7] According to the Siegmund/Frankenberg climate classification, subtropical is one of six climate zones in the world.[8]"

Roughly, a system which includes a material entity (at least partially) within its site and causally influences that entity may be considered to environ it.

name: water ice
comment: Water ice can appear transparent or opaque bluish-white color, depending on the presence of impurities or air inclusions. The addition of other materials such as soil may further alter its appearance.\n\nWhen speaking about ice on Earth, usually water ice is meant - the solid, crystalline form of water found in the atmosphere as snow crystals, hail, ice pellets, etc., and on the earth's surface in forms such as hoarfrost, rime, glaze, sea ice, glacier ice, ground ice, frazil, anchor ice, etc.\n\nThis form of water is, strictly speaking, called ice Ih, the Roman numeral I distinguishing it from more than a dozen other phases and the letter h distinguishing it from the metastable cubic phase ice Ic. Ice Ih is the only one of the several known phases of water ice that is stable at commonly occurring temperatures and pressures. (Some of the other forms have very unusual properties, ice VII, for example, being stable only at pressures above 22 400 kg/cm^2, but then existing at temperatures up to about 100C.)\n\nIt has an open structure with a specific gravity of 0.9166 which is slightly less than water; because the water molecules bond to their neighbors covalently only in four directions; it therefore floats on higher density water, where broken molecular bonds permit closer packing. All commonly occurring forms of ice are crystalline, although large single crystals are relatively rare except in glaciers. The ice crystal lattice possesses hexagonal symmetry that manifests itself in the gross forms of such single crystals as are sometimes found in snow. At an air pressure of one atmosphere, ice melts at 0 C by definition of the Celsius temperature scale. (Strictly speaking the equilibrium point among water, ice, and vapor occurs at +0.01C, the triple point.) On the other hand, ice does not invariably form in liquid water cooled below this temperature; it has a tendency to supercool, more so in the absence of ice nuclei.\n\nIn permafrost regions, ice may occupy voids in soils and rocks and may develop in a variety of forms. Ice may be colourless to pale blue or greenish-blue. It may appear white due to included gas bubbles; in exposures, ground ice may also appear black.\n\nIn nature ice is formed either by: (a) the freezing of water, (b) the condensation of atmospheric water vapour direct into ice crystals, (c) the compaction of snow with or without the motion of a glacier, or (d) the impregnation of porous snow masses with water which subsequently freeze.

name: ecozone
comment: ENVO contains this top-level class, but all instances will be in GAZ. The definition is preliminary and will be aligned to BFO.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology. Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories.

comment: Material parts of astronomical bodies generally have boundaries formed by discontinuities in qualities, composition, or other physical characterisitcs. These boundaries are sometimes sharp, and sometimes diffuse, with different classification systems and communities declaring varying thresholds (e.g. for where a shoreline, forest, or other entity begins and ends). However, some boundaries are declared by fiat - that is, by arbitrary human convention or decree - particularly by regulatory or other authorities and communities of practice. The classes in this hierarchy attempt to offer generalisable definitions that allow multiple classfiication systems to map to and interoperate through. If desired, we can create classes that declare thresholds used by a given authority or community under the more generic ones, annotated with source information.

comment: The definitions of forest can vary greatly, and different classes will be needed to support the major categories. Tree cover alone is not enough to distinguish between forests and plantations. The international definition proposed by the 2010 FAO Forestry Resource Assessment: "land spanning more than 0.5 ha with trees higher than 5 metres and canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ . It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use." - FAO.  2010. Global forest resources assessment 2010, Main report, FAO Forestry Paper 163. Rome.

comment: At this level, the depth of this layer is ambiguous. Some methods (telemetry) measure only the first few centimeters of the sea or ocean surface. In situ methods often sample the first few meters. Subclasses can be created for such cases.\nSea surface layer is also used to refer to the surfaces of oceans.

name: snow accumulation process
comment: This term is used both as a process and as an amount of mass added. Semantically speaking these are two distinct concepts (e.g., accumulation results in accumulation_amount of ice or snow gain), though accumulation_amount would more likely be an attribute.\n\nThe scope of this term varies depending on the definition.  Some definitions constrain themselves snow or ice added to glaciers; while others also include ice fields, snow cover, and/or floating ice.  How to resolve this depends on the scope desired.\n\nSome definitions include additional discussion of the the physics involved which would be useful for connecting glacier ontologies to atmospheric, hydrologic, etc. ontologies.  This information should be captured no matter how the inconsistencies above are resolved.

comment: Landforms may be natural or anthropogenic. This term has often has loose usage when referencing entities which are either subterranean or submerged below water bodies. In some cases, oceans themselves are considered landforms. Here, we have provided subclasses to resolve this ambiguity, but place oceans and other water bodies elsewhere.In later revisions, this hiearchy is likely to be reordered based on the formation processes of the entities within it.

def: "A sequence feature (continuous extent of biological sequence) that is of genomic origin (i.e. carries sequence from the genome of a cell or organism)" []
comment: 1. A feature being 'of genomic origin' here means only that its sequence has been located to the genome of some organism by alignment with some reference genome. This is because the sequence was originally identified in, or artificially created to replicate, sequence from an organism's genome. \n\n2. The location of a genomic feature is defined by start and end coordinates based on alignment with a reference genome. Genomic features can span any size from a complete chromosome, to a chromosomal band or region, to a gene, to a single base pair or even junction between base pairs (this would be a sequence feature with an extent of zero). \n\n3. As sequence features, instances of genomic features are identified by both their inherent *sequence* and their *position* in a genome - as determined by an alignment with some reference sequence. Accordingly, the 'ATG' start codon in the coding DNA sequence of the human AKT gene and the 'ATG' start codon in the human SHH gene represent two distinct genomic features despite having he same sequence, in virtue of their different positions in the genome.

def: "A specification of the genetic state of an organism, whether complete (defined over the whole genome) or incomplete (defined over a subset of the genome). Genotypes typically describe this genetic state as a diff between some variant component and a canonical reference." []
comment: 1. Scope of 'Genetic State': \n'Genetic state' is considered quite broadly in GENO to describe two general kinds of 'states'.  First, is traditional notion of 'allelic state' - defined as the complement of alleles present at a particular location or locations in a genome (i.e. across all homologous chromosomes containing this location). Here, a genotype can describe allelic state at a specific locus in a genome (an 'allelic genotype'), or describe the allelic state across the entire genome ('genomic genotype'). Second, this concept can also describe states of genomic features 'extrinsic' to their intrinsic sequence, such as the expression status of a gene as a result of being specifically targeted by experimental interventions such as RNAi, morpholinos, or CRISPRs.\n\n2. Genotype Subtypes:\nIn GENO, we use the term 'intrinsic' for genotypes describing variation in genomic sequence, and 'extrinsic' for genotypes describing variation in gene expression (e.g. resulting from the targeted experimental knock-down or over-expression of endogenous genes).  We use the term 'effective genotype' to describe the total intrinsic and extrinsic variation in a cell or organism at the time a phenotypic assessment is performed. \n\nTwo more precise conccepts are subsumed by the notion of an 'intrinsic genotype': (1) 'allelic genotypes', which specify allelic state at a single genomic location; and (2) 'genomic genotypes', which specify allelic state across an entire genome.  In both cases, allelic state is typically specified in terms of a differential between a reference and a set of 1 or more known variant features.\n\n3. The Genotype Partonomy: \n'Genomic genotypes' describing sequence variation across an entire genome are 'decomposed' in GENO into a partonomy  of more granular levels of variation. These levels are defined to be meaningful to biologists in their attempts to relate genetic variation to phenotypic features. They include 'genomic variation complement' (GVC), 'variant single locus complement' (VSLC), 'allele', 'haplotype', 'sequence alteration', and 'genomic background' classes.  For example, the components of the zebrafish genotype "fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a>; fgf3<t24149/+>[AB]", described at  zfin.org/ZDB-FISH-150901-9362, include the following elements:\n\n - GVC: fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a>; fgf3<t24149/+> (total intrinsic variation in the genome)\n - Genomic Background: AB (the reference against which the GVC is variant)\n - VSLC1:  fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a> (homozygous complement of gene alleles at one known variant locus)\n - VSLC2:  fgf3<t24149/+> (heterozygous complement of gene alleles at another known variant locus)\n - Allele 1:  fgf8a<ti282a>   (variant version of the fgf8a gene, present in two copies)\n - Allele 2:  fgf3<t24149>    (variant version of the fgf3 gene, present in one copy)\n - Allele 3:   fgf3<+>    (wild-type version of the fgf3 gene, present in one copy)\n - Sequence Alteration1: <ti282a>  (the specific mutation within the fgf8a gene that makes it variant)\n - Sequence Alteration2: <t24149> (the specific mutation within the fgf3 gene that makes it variant)\n\nA graphical representation of this decomposition that maps each element to a visual depiction of the portion of a genome it denotes can be found here: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/GENO-ontology/blob/develop/README.md\n\nOne reason that explicit representation of these levels is important is because it is at these levels that phenotypic features are annotated to genetic variations in different clinical and model organism databases For example, ZFIN typically annotates phenotypes to effective genotypes, MGI to intrinsic genotypes, Wormbase to variant alleles, and ClinVar to haplotypes and sequence alterations. The ability to decompose a genotype into representations at these levels allows us to "propagate phenotypes" up or down the partonomy (e.g. infer associations of phenotypes annotated to a genotype to its more granular levels of variation and the gene(s) affected). This helps to supporting integrated analysis of G2P data.

'Sets' are used to represent entities that are typically collections of more than one member - e.g. the set of chromosomes that make up the human genome. But we allow for sets that contain 0 members (an 'empty' set) or 1 member (a 'singleton' or 'unit' set), consistent with the concept of 'mathematical sets'. For example, a 'single locus complement' at an X-linked locus in a XY male will consist of only one allele, as there is only one X-chromosome in the genome. Note also that sets may contain duplicates (i.e. more than one member representing the same feature). For example, a homozygous 'single locus complement' is a set comprised of two of the same feature.\n\nThe notion of a 'genomic feature set' differs from that of a 'genomic sequence set' in that we are counting how many copies of the same *sequence feature* exist in a genome, as opposed to how many of the same *sequence*. 'Genomic feature sets are useful for representing things like 'single locus complements', where members are sequence features whose identity is dependent on their location. By contrast, 'genomic sequence sets' are useful for describing things like 'copy number complements', which are concerned only with how many copies of a sequence exist in a genome, regardless of the location where these reside.

comment: 1. A genomic location (aka locus) is defined by its begin and end coordinates on a reference genome, independent of a particular sequence that may reside there.  In GENO, we say that a genomic location is occupied_by a 'sequence feature' - where the identity of this feature depends on both it sequence, and its location in the genome (i.e. the locus it occupies).  For example, the 'ATG' sequence beginning the ORF of the human SHH gene shares the *same sequence* as the 'ATG' beginning the ORF of the human AKT gene. But these are *distinct sequence features* because they occupy different genomic locations. \n	\n2. A given genomic location (e.g. the human SHH gene locus) may be occupied by different alleles (e.g. different alleles of the SHH gene). Within the genome of a single diploid organism, there is potential for two alleles to exist at such a locus (i.e. two different versions of the SHH gene).  And across genomes of all members of a species, many more alleles of the SHH gene may exist and occupy this same locus.\n\n3. The notion of a genomic location in the realm of biological sequences is analogous to a BFO:spatiotemporal region in the realm of physical entities. A spatiotemporal region can be occupied_by physical objects, while a genomic location is occupied_by sequence features.

We will work to resolve these questions and ideally converge these concepts in the future.\n\nWe don't link a Genomic Location to a specific reference sequence because in the FALDO model (which GENO adopts with the exception of swapping GENO:Genomic Locus for FALDO:Region), allows the start and end positions of a region to be defined on separate reference sequences.

comment: Modeling sequence entities at this 'qualified' level is useful for distinguishing cases where features with identical sequence and position as separate instances - based on their material bearers being found in different contexts. For example, consider a situation where the zebrafish shha gene (a sequence feature) is targeted in two experimental groups of fish by two different morpholinos, and phenotypes are assessed for each.  We want to be able to represent two 'variants' of the shha gene in this scenario as separate 'qualified sequence feature' instances so we can capture data about the phenotypes resulting from each - just as we would separately represent to different sequence variants (alleles) of the shha gene at the sequence feature level so that we can track their associated phenotypes.

def: "A biological process is the execution of a genetically-encoded biological module or program. It consists of all the steps required to achieve the specific biological objective of the module. A biological process is accomplished by a particular set of molecular functions carried out by specific gene products (or macromolecular complexes), often in a highly regulated manner and in a particular temporal sequence." [GOC:pdt]
comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this.

It leaves open if an organization is a material entity or a dependent continuant, as no consensus was reached on that.  The current placement as material is therefore temporary, in order to move forward with development. Here is the entire email summary, on which the definition is based:\n\n1) there are organization_member_roles (president, treasurer, branch\neditor), with individual persons as bearers\n\n2) there are organization_roles (employer, owner, vendor, patent holder)\n\n3) an organization has a charter / rules / bylaws, which specify what roles\nthere are, how they should be realized, and how to modify the\ncharter/rules/bylaws themselves.\n\nIt is debatable what the organization itself is (some kind of dependent\ncontinuant or an aggregate of people). This also determines who/what the\nbearer of organization_roles' are. My personal favorite is still to define\norganization as a kind of 'legal entity', but thinking it through leads to\nall kinds of questions that are clearly outside the scope of OBI.\n\nInterestingly enough, it does not seem to matter much where we place\norganization itself, as long as we can subclass it (University, Corporation,\nGovernment Agency, Hospital), instantiate it (Affymetrix, NCBI, NIH, ISO,\nW3C, University of Oklahoma), and have it play roles.\n\nThis leads to my proposal: We define organization through the statements 1 -\n3 above, but without an 'is a' statement for now. We can leave it in its\ncurrent place in the is_a hierarchy (material entity) or move it up to\n'continuant'. We leave further clarifications to BFO, and close this issue\nfor now." xsd:string

Therefore we have chosen to specifically exclude reagents from the definition of \"device\", and are enumerating the types of roles that a reagent can perform.\n\n2013-6-5 MHB: The following clarifications are outcomes of the May 2013 Philly Workshop. Reagents are distinguished from devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during the realization of their experimental role. By contrast, devices do not participate in such chemical reactions/interactions.  Note that there are cases where devices use reagent components during their operation, where the reagent-device distinction is less clear.  For example:\n\n(1) An HPLC machine is considered a device, but has a column that holds a stationary phase resin as an operational component.  This resin qualifies as a device if it participates purely in size exclusion, but bears a reagent role that is realized in the running of a column if it interacts electrostatically or chemically with the evaluant. The container the resin is in (“the column”) considered alone is a device. So the entire column as well as the entire HPLC machine are devices that have a reagent as an operating part.\n\n(2) A pH meter is a device, but its electrode component bears a reagent role in virtue of its interacting directly with the evaluant in execution of an assay.\n\n(3) A gel running  box  is a device that has a metallic lead as a component that participates in a chemical reaction with the running buffer when a charge is passed through it.  This metallic lead is considered to have a reagent role as a component of this device realized in the running of a gel.\n\nIn the examples above, a reagent is an operational component of a device, but the device itself does not realize a reagent role (as bearing a reagent role is not transitive across the part_of relation).  In this way, the asserted disjointness between a reagent and device holds, as both roles are never realized in the same bearer during execution of an assay." xsd:string

def: "A k-means clustering is a data transformation which achieves a class discovery or partitioning objective, which takes as input a collection of objects (represented as points in multidimensional space) and which partitions them into a specified number k of clusters. The algorithm attempts to find the centers of natural clusters in the data. The most common form of the algorithm starts by partitioning the input points into k initial sets, either at random or using some heuristic data. It then calculates the mean point, or centroid, of each set. It constructs a new partition by associating each point with the closest centroid. Then the centroids are recalculated for the new clusters, and the algorithm repeated by alternate applications of these two steps until convergence, which is obtained when the points no longer switch clusters (or alternatively centroids are no longer changed)."

comment: Ecological community is defined broadly here, but includes both ecological interactions (inherited from parent term community) and spatial co-existence. It may be used to describe every organisms living in an area, but is often used to refer only to organisms of a particular taxon or guild (e.g., the plant community, the insect community, the herbivore community). The word community, as it often used to describe a group of humans living together, is a type of single-species collection of organisms, not an ecological community.

comment: Roots function in the absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, anchoring the plant body to the substrate and supporting it, storage of food and nutrients, and vegetative reproduction. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with soil-borne microorganisms. Roots are usually positively geotropic and found underground, although there are many exceptions such as the aerial roots of orchids. Roots often form secondary thickening from the root lateral meristem (PO:0006308). Commonly thought of as one of the three basic parts of the plant body, along with the shoot axis (PO:0025029) and leaves (PO:0025034).

comment: A whole plant (PO:0000003) in the sporophyte development stage usually has twice the chromosome complement of a plant in the gametophytic phase, but may not in the case of apogamy. Examples of apogamy include both naturally occurring instances (such as sporophytes arising form haploid cells as in bryophytes or ferns) as well as in vitro instances (such as haploid embryo culture or in vitro fusion of non-gamete cells or protoplasts). During the sporophyte development stage, a plant may produce meiospores by meiosis.

This characteristic can lead to more localized and potentially more damaging effects on cells and tissues.\n\nEnhanced Biological Effectiveness: Due to its high LET, heavy ion radiation in many cases has enhanced biological effectiveness, meaning it can cause more severe biological damage per unit of absorbed dose compared to other types of radiation.\n\nSpace Radiation: Heavy ions are a component of the galactic cosmic radiation present in space.\n\nIn common use, the distinction between heavy ions and light ions is somewhat flexible and context dependent. For example, \"heavy\" is sometimes used to refer to any ion heavier than a helium nucleus or even a proton; in practice the dividing line between light and heavy lies around atomic numbers 6-10." xsd:string

The quality of control inhering in the sample role exists as a result of the historical treatment of the sample. In a controlled experiment, two or more virtually identical experiments are conducted, but the factor being tested is varied in only one of them. This serves to isolate any causal phenomena. A control may have been subject to treatments during the experiment that might alter its state or behaviour and is therefore distinguishable from the sample as initial input into the experiment. However such treatments should in all cases but that of the variable under scrutiny, be the same as the experimental sample." []

comment: A sequence feature is an extent of 'located' biological sequence, whose identity is determined by both its inherent sequence (ordering of monomeric units) and its position (start and end coordinates based on alignment with some reference). By contrast, 'biological sequences' are identified and distinguished only by their inehrent sequence, and not their position.  Accordingly, the 'ATG' start codon in the coding DNA sequence of the human AKT gene is the same 'sequence' as the 'ATG' start codon in the human SHH gene, but these represent two distinct 'sequence features' in virtue of their different positions in the genome.

'Qualified sequence feature' identity is additionally dependent on some aspect of the physical context of the genetic material in which the feature is concretized. This third criteria is extrinsic to its sequence and its genomic location. For example, the feature's physical concretization being targeted by a gene knockdown reagent in a cell (e.g. the zebrafish Shha gene as targeted by the morpholino 'Shha-MO1'), or its being transiently expressed from a recombinant expression construct (e.g. the human SHH gene as expressed in a  mouse Shh knock-out cell line), or its having been epigenetically modified in a way that alters its expression level or pattern (e.g. the human SHH gene with a specific methylation pattern)." xsd:string

comment: A genome is considered the complement of all heritable sequence features in a given cell or organism (chromosomal or extrachromosomal).

def: "Anatomical surface structure found in many aquatic organisms. It is a respiration organ whose function is the extraction of oxygen from water and the excretion of carbon dioxide. The microscopic structure of a gill is such that it presents a very large surface area to the external environment. Gills usually consist of thin filaments of tissue, branches, or slender tufted processes which have a highly folded surface to increase surface area. A high surface area is crucial to the gas exchange of aquatic organisms as water contains only 1/20 parts dissolved Oxygen compared to air. With the exception of some aquatic insects, the filaments and lamellae (folds) contain blood or coelomic fluid, from which gases are exchanged through the thin walls. Oxygen is carried by the blood to other parts of the body. Carbon dioxide passes from the blood through the thin gill tissue into the water. Gills or gill-like organs, located in different parts of the body, are found in various groups of aquatic animals, including mollusks, crustaceans, insects, fish, and amphibians." []

comment: "A unit used to express distances on a genetic map. In genetic mapping, distances between markers are determined by measuring the rate of meoitic recombination between them, which increases proportionately with the distance separating them. A cM is defined as the length of an interval in which there is a 1% probability of recombination. On the average, 1 cM is roughly equivalent to 1 megabase (Mb) of DNA, although this can vary widely due to hot and cold spots of recombination."

name: Act of Estimation
comment: Although the boundary between Act of Estimation and guessing is vague, estimation can be partially distinguished from guessing in that every Act of Estimation has as input some relevant information; whereas an act of guessing can occur sans information (or at least sans pertinent information). For example, if Mr. Green were asked how many blades of grass are in his lawn, he could simply choose a number (i.e. he could guess) or he could estimate the number by counting how many baldes of grass are in 1 square foot of his lawn, measuring the square footage of his lawn, and then multiplying these values to arrive at a number. Hence, many estimates may be loosely considered to be educated guesses.
comment: Note that, while every Act of Measuring arguably involves some degree of estimation (for example, a measuring instrument rounding to the nearest ten-thousandth or an Agent reading an analog display), it would be a mistake to classify all Acts of Measuring as Acts of Estimation. This holds even for cases (e.g. census taking) in which sofisticated estimations are often more accurate than other means of measuring (e.g. enumeration).

In many cases, the directives issued by Authority Roles are backed by threats of punishment or sanction for failure to comply, but the issuing of a directive plus a threat is not sufficient for authority.

comment: An Act of Prediction may involve the use of some or no relevant information. An Act of Prediction that utilizes relevant information may also be (or at least involve) an Act of Estimation. Hence, these two classes are not disjoint.

Even if some dependent entity is described as being the target, the material thing for which that dependent entity depends is the object of a targeting process.

comment: 'Deviation Measurement Information Content Entity' and 'Veracity Measurement Information Content Entity' are complementary notions. Deviation is a measure of whether reality conforms to an ICE (e.g., a plan or prediction), whereas Veracity is a measure of whether a Descriptive ICE conforms to reality.
comment: Note, the term 'accuracy' is avoided due to its ambiguity between: correctness-of-performance (see: 'Reliability Measurement Information Content Entity'), correctness-of-information ('Veracity Measurement Information Content Entity'), and adherance-to-expectations (see: 'Deviation Measurement Information Content Entity').

comment: Note that, while most if not all Acts of Appraisal involve some estimating and many Acts of Estimation involve some appraising (i.e. these classes are not disjoint), neither class subsumes the other. For example, some Acts of Appraisal (e.g. a tax assessor appraising the value of a building) impart a normative element to the measured value while others (e.g. a gustatory appraisal that fresh green beans taste better than canned green beans) involve complete information. Furthermore, many Acts of Estimation (e.g. estimating the height of a tree) are concerned solely with determining a numerical value (as opposed to the nature, value, importance, condition, or quality).

Deviation is a measure of whether reality conforms to an ICE (e.g., a plan or prediction), whereas Veracity is a measure of whether a Descriptive ICE conforms to reality.
comment: Note, the term 'accuracy' is avoided due to its ambiguity between: correctness-of-performance (see: 'Reliability Measurement Information Content Entity'), correctness-of-information (see: 'Veracity Measurement Information Content Entity'), and adherance-to-expectations ('Deviation Measurement Information Content Entity').

comment: There is no class 'Time Zone' (the region), only 'Time Zone Identifier' (the designator for some region). Instances of 'Time Zone Identifier' should be related to instances of 'Information Bearing Entity' by means of the object properites 'uses time zone identifier' and 'time zone identifier used by' as appropriate. This is supposed to be analogous to the way we represent the relationship between measurement values and measurement units, where the relevant instance of Information Bearing Entity 'uses measurement unit' some instance of Measurement Unit (i.e., an instance of Information Content Entity).

name: Proportional Ratio Measurement Information Content Entity
comment: A percentage is one way to express a proportional measure where the decimal expression of the proportion is multiplied by 100, thus giving the proportional value with respect to a whole of 100. E.g., the ratio of pigs to cows on a farm is 44 to 79 (44:79 or 44/79). The proportion of pigs to total animals is 44 to 123 or 44/123. The percentage of pigs is the decimal equivalent of the proportion (0.36) multiplied by a 100 (36%). The percentage can be expressed as a proportion where the numerator value is transformed for a denominator of 100, i.e., 36 of a 100 animals are pigs (36/100).
comment: We may want to add either a subclass for Percentage or a data property (has percentage value) that links the percentage expression for a proportion to the relevant IBE.

comment: An empty notebook, when manufactured, is a medium but not yet a carrier of information content. However, a book, in the sense of a novel or collection of philosophical essays or poems, depends necessarily on it carrying some information content. Thus, there are no empty books. Likewise, there are no empty databases, only portions of digital storage that have not yet been configured to carry some information content according to a database software application.

Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string

def: "A specification of the genetic state of an organism, whether complete (defined over the whole genome) or incomplete (defined over a subset of the genome). Genotypes typically describe this genetic state as a diff between some variant component and a canonical reference." []
comment: 1. Scope of 'Genetic State': \n'Genetic state' is considered quite broadly in GENO to describe two general kinds of 'states'.  First, is traditional notion of 'allelic state' - defined as the complement of alleles present at a particular location or locations in a genome (i.e. across all homologous chromosomes containing this location). Here, a genotype can describe allelic state at a specific locus in a genome (an 'allelic genotype'), or describe the allelic state across the entire genome ('genomic genotype'). Second, this concept can also describe states of genomic features 'extrinsic' to their intrinsic sequence, such as the expression status of a gene as a result of being specifically targeted by experimental interventions such as RNAi, morpholinos, or CRISPRs.\n\n2. Genotype Subtypes:\nIn GENO, we use the term 'intrinsic' for genotypes describing variation in genomic sequence, and 'extrinsic' for genotypes describing variation in gene expression (e.g. resulting from the targeted experimental knock-down or over-expression of endogenous genes).  We use the term 'effective genotype' to describe the total intrinsic and extrinsic variation in a cell or organism at the time a phenotypic assessment is performed. \n\nTwo more precise conccepts are subsumed by the notion of an 'intrinsic genotype': (1) 'allelic genotypes', which specify allelic state at a single genomic location; and (2) 'genomic genotypes', which specify allelic state across an entire genome.  In both cases, allelic state is typically specified in terms of a differential between a reference and a set of 1 or more known variant features.\n\n3. The Genotype Partonomy: \n'Genomic genotypes' describing sequence variation across an entire genome are 'decomposed' in GENO into a partonomy  of more granular levels of variation. These levels are defined to be meaningful to biologists in their attempts to relate genetic variation to phenotypic features. They include 'genomic variation complement' (GVC), 'variant single locus complement' (VSLC), 'allele', 'haplotype', 'sequence alteration', and 'genomic background' classes.  For example, the components of the zebrafish genotype "fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a>; fgf3<t24149/+>[AB]", described at  zfin.org/ZDB-FISH-150901-9362, include the following elements:\n\n - GVC: fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a>; fgf3<t24149/+> (total intrinsic variation in the genome)\n - Genomic Background: AB (the reference against which the GVC is variant)\n - VSLC1:  fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a> (homozygous complement of gene alleles at one known variant locus)\n - VSLC2:  fgf3<t24149/+> (heterozygous complement of gene alleles at another known variant locus)\n - Allele 1:  fgf8a<ti282a>   (variant version of the fgf8a gene, present in two copies)\n - Allele 2:  fgf3<t24149>    (variant version of the fgf3 gene, present in one copy)\n - Allele 3:   fgf3<+>    (wild-type version of the fgf3 gene, present in one copy)\n - Sequence Alteration1: <ti282a>  (the specific mutation within the fgf8a gene that makes it variant)\n - Sequence Alteration2: <t24149> (the specific mutation within the fgf3 gene that makes it variant)\n\nA graphical representation of this decomposition that maps each element to a visual depiction of the portion of a genome it denotes can be found here: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/GENO-ontology/blob/develop/README.md\n\nOne reason that explicit representation of these levels is important is because it is at these levels that phenotypic features are annotated to genetic variations in different clinical and model organism databases For example, ZFIN typically annotates phenotypes to effective genotypes, MGI to intrinsic genotypes, Wormbase to variant alleles, and ClinVar to haplotypes and sequence alterations. The ability to decompose a genotype into representations at these levels allows us to "propagate phenotypes" up or down the partonomy (e.g. infer associations of phenotypes annotated to a genotype to its more granular levels of variation and the gene(s) affected). This helps to supporting integrated analysis of G2P data.
property_value: IAO:0000116 "As information artifacts, genotypes specify the state of a genome be defining a diff between some canonical reference and a variant or alternate sequence that replaces the corresponding portion of the reference. We can consider a genotype then as a collection of these reference and variant features, along with some rule for operating on them and resolve a final single sequence. This is valid ontologically because we commit only to sequence features being GDCs - which allows for their concretization in either biological or informational patterns. Accordingly, a particular gene allele, such as shh<tbx292>, can be part of a genome in a biological sense and part of a genotype in an informational sense. This idea underpins the 'genotype partonomy' at the core of the GENO model that decomposes a complete genotype into its more fundamental parts, including alleles and allele complements, as described in the comment above." xsd:string

comment: In GENO we define three levels of sequence artifacts: (1) biological sequences, (2) sequence features, and (3) qualified sequence features. The identify criteria for a 'biological sequence' include only its inherent sequence (the ordered string of units that comprise it). The identity criteria for a 'sequence feature' include its sequence and position (where it resides - i.e. its location based on how it maps to a reference or standard) The identity criteria for a 'qualified sequence feature' include its component sequence feature (defined by its sequence and position), and the material context of its bearer in a cell or organism. This context can include direct epigenetic modification, or being targeted by gene knockdown reagents such as morpholinos or RNAi, or being transiently overexpressed from a transgenic construct in a cell or organism.

def: "relation that links two events, processes, states, or objects such that one event, process, state, or object (a cause) contributes to the production of another event, process, state, or object (an effect) where the cause is partly or wholly responsible for the effect, and the effect is partly or wholly dependent on the cause."

property_value: IAO:0000116 "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative?\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string

comment: It is possible that this relation should be a functional property, that is for all x, y, z if x describes y and x describes z then y = z. For example, if a financial report x describes the quarterly results of a company y and that same financial report describes the quarterly results of a company z, then it should be inferred that companies y and z are the same. We refrained from classifying the relation as a functional property on the concern that descriptions are multifaceted and so consequently it may be that the same report would contain descriptions of multiple entities.
