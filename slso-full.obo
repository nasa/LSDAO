property_value: IAO:0000116 "BFO 2 Reference: The realm of occurrents is less pervasively marked by the presence of natural units than is the case in the realm of independent continuants. Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay. Clear examples of boundaries of processes are almost always of the fiat sort (midnight, a time of death as declared in an operating theater or on a death certificate, the initiation of a state of war)" xsd:string

property_value: scopeNote "Denne klasse er valgfri og ikke alle kataloger vil anvende denne klasse. Den kan anvendes i de kataloger hvor der skelnes mellem metadata om datasættet eller datatjenesten og metadata om selve posten til registreringen af datasættet eller datatjenesten i kataloget. Udgivelsesdatoen for datasættet afspejler for eksempel den dato hvor informationerne oprindeligt blev gjort tilgængelige af udgiveren, hvorimod udgivelsesdatoen for katalogposten er den dato hvor datasættet blev føjet til kataloget. I de tilfælde hvor de to datoer er forskellige eller hvor blot sidstnævnte er kendt, bør udgivelsesdatoen kun angives for katalogposten.

property_value: scopeNote "Esta clase es opcional y no todos los catálogos la utilizarán. Esta clase existe para catálogos que hacen una distinción entre los metadatos acerca de un conjunto de datos o un servicio de datos y los metadatos acerca de una entrada en ese conjunto de datos en el catálogo. Por ejemplo, la propiedad sobre la fecha de la publicación de los datos refleja la fecha en que la información fue originalmente publicada, mientras que la fecha de publicación del registro del catálogo es la fecha en que los datos se agregaron al mismo. En caso en que ambas fechas fueran diferentes, o en que sólo la fecha de publicación del registro del catálogo estuviera disponible, sólo debe especificarse en el registro del catálogo. Tengan en cuenta que la ontología PROV de W3C permite describir otra información sobre la proveniencia de los datos, como por ejemplo detalles del proceso y de los agentes involucrados en algún cambio específico a los datos." xsd:string
property_value: scopeNote "Questa classe è opzionale e non tutti i cataloghi la utilizzeranno. Esiste per cataloghi in cui si opera una distinzione tra i metadati relativi al dataset ed i metadati relativi alla gestione del dataset nel catalogo. Ad esempio, la  proprietà per indicare la data di pubblicazione del dataset rifletterà la data in cui l'informazione è stata originariamente messa a disposizione dalla casa editrice, mentre la data di pubblicazione per il record nel catalogo rifletterà la data in cui il dataset è stato aggiunto al catalogo. Nei casi dove solo quest'ultima sia nota, si utilizzerà esclusivamente la data di  pubblicazione relativa al record del catalogo. Si noti che l'Ontologia W3C PROV permette di descrivere ulteriori informazioni sulla provenienza, quali i dettagli del processo, la procedura e l'agente coinvolto in una particolare modifica di un dataset." xsd:string
property_value: scopeNote "Tato třída je volitelná a ne všechny katalogy ji využijí. Existuje pro katalogy, ve kterých se rozlišují metadata datové sady či datové služby a metadata o záznamu o datové sadě či datové službě v katalogu. Například datum publikace datové sady odráží datum, kdy byla datová sada původně zveřejněna poskytovatelem dat, zatímco datum publikace katalogizačního záznamu je datum zanesení datové sady do katalogu. V případech kdy se obě data liší, nebo je známo jen to druhé, by mělo být specifikováno jen datum publikace katalogizačního záznamu. Všimněte si, že ontologie W3C PROV umožňuje popsat další informace o původu jako například podrobnosti o procesu konkrétní změny datové sady a jeho účastnících." xsd:string
property_value: scopeNote "This class is optional and not all catalogs will use it. It exists for catalogs where a distinction is made between metadata about a dataset or data service and metadata about the entry for the dataset or data service in the catalog. For example, the publication date property of the dataset reflects the date when the information was originally made available by the publishing agency, while the publication date of the catalog record is the date when the dataset was added to the catalog. In cases where both dates differ, or where only the latter is known, the publication date should only be specified for the catalog record. Notice that the W3C PROV Ontology allows describing further provenance information such as the details of the process and the agent involved in a particular change to a dataset." xsd:string
property_value: scopeNote "Αυτή η κλάση είναι προαιρετική και δεν χρησιμοποιείται από όλους τους καταλόγους. Υπάρχει για τις περιπτώσεις καταλόγων όπου γίνεται διαχωρισμός μεταξύ των μεταδεδομένων για το σύνολο των δεδομένων και των μεταδεδομένων για την καταγραφή του συνόλου δεδομένων εντός του καταλόγου. Για παράδειγμα, η ιδιότητα της ημερομηνίας δημοσίευσης του συνόλου δεδομένων δείχνει την ημερομηνία κατά την οποία οι πληροφορίες έγιναν διαθέσιμες από τον φορέα δημοσίευσης, ενώ η ημερομηνία δημοσίευσης της καταγραφής του καταλόγου δείχνει την ημερομηνία που το σύνολο δεδομένων προστέθηκε στον κατάλογο. Σε περιπτώσεις που οι δύο ημερομηνίες διαφέρουν, ή που μόνο η τελευταία είναι γνωστή, η ημερομηνία δημοσίευσης θα πρέπει να δίνεται για την καταγραφή του καταλόγου. Να σημειωθεί πως η οντολογία W3C PROV επιτρέπει την περιγραφή επιπλέον πληροφοριών ιστορικού όπως λεπτομέρειες για τη διαδικασία και τον δράστη που εμπλέκονται σε μία συγκεκριμένη αλλαγή εντός του συνόλου δεδομένων." xsd:string
property_value: scopeNote "このクラスはオプションで、すべてのカタログがそれを用いるとは限りません。これは、データセットに関するメタデータとカタログ内のデータセットのエントリーに関するメタデータとで区別が行われるカタログのために存在しています。例えば、データセットの公開日プロパティーは、公開機関が情報を最初に利用可能とした日付を示しますが、カタログ・レコードの公開日は、データセットがカタログに追加された日付です。両方の日付が異っていたり、後者だけが分かっている場合は、カタログ・レコードに対してのみ公開日を指定すべきです。W3CのPROVオントロジー[prov-o]を用いれば、データセットに対する特定の変更に関連するプロセスやエージェントの詳細などの、さらに詳しい来歴情報の記述が可能となることに注意してください。" xsd:string

A body of water does not have to be still or contained; Rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are also considered bodies of water.

comment: The definitions of forest can vary greatly, and different classes will be needed to support the major categories. Tree cover alone is not enough to distinguish between forests and plantations. The international definition proposed by the 2010 FAO Forestry Resource Assessment: "land spanning more than 0.5 ha with trees higher than 5 metres and canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ . It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use." - FAO.  2010. Global forest resources assessment 2010, Main report, FAO Forestry Paper 163. Rome.

comment: The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 μm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 4–5 μm, and colloid chemists use 1 μm. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 μm and silt particles as being larger. Mixtures of sand, silt and less than 40% clay are called loam. {xref="Properties"}

def: "An environmental material which is primarily composed of minerals, varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, interstitial gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil]
comment: 'In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the 'solid geology'. Soil is commonly referred to as "earth" or "dirt"; technically, the term "dirt" should be restricted to displaced soil.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil\n\n" The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.\n\nThe lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm."

comment: This definition is intentionally ambiguous to support the multiple thresholds set by different authorities.The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 μm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 4–5 μm, and colloid chemists use 1 μm. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 μm and silt particles as being larger. Mixtures of sand, silt and less than 40% clay are called loam. Similar mixtures with greater than 40% clay are often considered clay soils. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay"}

comment: This class is distinct from a geometric surface, which is two-dimensional. The idea of "uppermost" may be problematic. Further, the definition of layer (the superclass of surface in rev 133) references surface. This may be another issue. Perhaps this can be made into an inferred class using 'bounding layer of' some material entity, note that 'bounding layer' implies containment, which may not be valid here.

def: "MERGED DEFINITION:\nTARGET DEFINITION: An oceanographic feature that involves wind-driven motion of dense, cooler, and usually nutrient-rich water towards the ocean surface, replacing the warmer, usually nutrient-deplete surface water.\n--------------------\nSOURCE DEFINITION: A marine upwelling is a net flow of marine water to the surface of the water column from deeper regions. This is often a result of surface water displacement off continental coasts by wind action. Localised upwellings may also occur along divergent fronts around eddies and along some of the major oceanographic features. Deeper waters often have higher nutrient content; consequently blooms of primary producers, such as planktonic algae, are generally observed around upwelling zones."

name: silt
def: "Particulate environmental material which is primarily composed of silt particles." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silt]
comment: This definition is intentionally ambiguous to support the multiple thresholds set by different authorities. Some authorities consider this soil material that contains 80% or more silt and less than 12% clay. In the Udden-Wentworth scale (due to Krumbein), silt particles range between 0.0039 to 0.0625 mm, larger than clay but smaller than sand particles. ISO 14688 grades silts between 0.002 mm and 0.063 mm. In actuality, silt is chemically distinct from clay, and unlike clay, grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions; furthermore, their size ranges overlap. Clays are formed from thin plate-shaped particles held together by electrostatic forces, so present a cohesion. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Texture Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.05 mm particle size. The USDA system has been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and the AASHTO Soil Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.075 mm particle size (i.e., material passing the #200 sieve). Silts and clays are distinguished mechanically by their plasticity. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silt", xref="https://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/glossary/t/index.html"}

[]
comment: As with most other climatic zones and conditions, multiple classification schemes have somehat different definitions and criteria. To quote from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ "Several methods have been used to define the subtropical climate. In the Trewartha climate classification, a subtropical region should have at least eight months with a mean temperature of 10 °C (50.0 °F) or above. German climatologists Carl Troll and Karlheinz Paffen defined Warm temperate zones as plain and hilly lands having an average temperature of the coldest month between 2 °C (35.6 °F) and 13 °C (55.4 °F) in the Northern Hemisphere and between 6 °C (42.8 °F) and 13 °C (55.4 °F) in the Southern Hemisphere, excluding oceanic and continental climates. According to the Troll-Paffen climate classification, there generally exists one large subtropical zone named the warm-temperate subtropical zone,[4] which is subdivided into seven smaller areas.[5]\n\nAccording to the E. Neef climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into two parts: Rainy winters of the west sides and Eastern subtropical climate.[6] According to the Wilhelm Lauer & Peter Frankenberg climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into three parts: high-continental, continental, and maritime.[7] According to the Siegmund/Frankenberg climate classification, subtropical is one of six climate zones in the world.[8]"

Roughly, a system which includes a material entity (at least partially) within its site and causally influences that entity may be considered to environ it. Following the completion of this alignment, this class' definition and the definitions of its subclasses will be revised.

def: "Ice which is formed from water." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice]
comment: Water ice can appear transparent or opaque bluish-white color, depending on the presence of impurities or air inclusions. The addition of other materials such as soil may further alter its appearance.\n\nWhen speaking about ice on Earth, usually water ice is meant - the solid, crystalline form of water found in the atmosphere as snow crystals, hail, ice pellets, etc., and on the earth's surface in forms such as hoarfrost, rime, glaze, sea ice, glacier ice, ground ice, frazil, anchor ice, etc.\n\nThis form of water is, strictly speaking, called ice Ih, the Roman numeral I distinguishing it from more than a dozen other phases and the letter h distinguishing it from the metastable cubic phase ice Ic. Ice Ih is the only one of the several known phases of water ice that is stable at commonly occurring temperatures and pressures. (Some of the other forms have very unusual properties, ice VII, for example, being stable only at pressures above 22 400 kg/cm^2, but then existing at temperatures up to about 100C.)\n\nIt has an open structure with a specific gravity of 0.9166 which is slightly less than water; because the water molecules bond to their neighbors covalently only in four directions; it therefore floats on higher density water, where broken molecular bonds permit closer packing. All commonly occurring forms of ice are crystalline, although large single crystals are relatively rare except in glaciers. The ice crystal lattice possesses hexagonal symmetry that manifests itself in the gross forms of such single crystals as are sometimes found in snow. At an air pressure of one atmosphere, ice melts at 0 C by definition of the Celsius temperature scale. (Strictly speaking the equilibrium point among water, ice, and vapor occurs at +0.01C, the triple point.) On the other hand, ice does not invariably form in liquid water cooled below this temperature; it has a tendency to supercool, more so in the absence of ice nuclei.\n\nIn permafrost regions, ice may occupy voids in soils and rocks and may develop in a variety of forms. Ice may be colourless to pale blue or greenish-blue. It may appear white due to included gas bubbles; in exposures, ground ice may also appear black.\n\nIn nature ice is formed either by: (a) the freezing of water, (b) the condensation of atmospheric water vapour direct into ice crystals, (c) the compaction of snow with or without the motion of a glacier, or (d) the impregnation of porous snow masses with water which subsequently freeze.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecozone]
comment: ENVO contains this top-level class, but all instances will be in GAZ. The definition is preliminary and will be aligned to BFO.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology. Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories.

comment: Material parts of astronomical bodies generally have boundaries formed by discontinuities in qualities, composition, or other physical characterisitcs. These boundaries are sometimes sharp, and sometimes diffuse, with different classification systems and communities declaring varying thresholds (e.g. for where a shoreline, forest, or other entity begins and ends). However, some boundaries are declared by fiat - that is, by arbitrary human convention or decree - particularly by regulatory or other authorities and communities of practice. The classes in this hierarchy attempt to offer generalisable definitions that allow multiple classfiication systems to map to and interoperate through. If desired, we can create classes that declare thresholds used by a given authority or community under the more generic ones, annotated with source information.

Landforms factored into geodiversity metrics typically include folds, faults, and other expressions of morphology or relations between units of earth material. Natural processes that are included in measures of geodiversity are those which either maintain or change materials or geoforms, including tectonics, sediment transport, and pedogenesis.

comment: The definitions of forest can vary greatly, and different classes will be needed to support the major categories. Tree cover alone is not enough to distinguish between forests and plantations. The international definition proposed by the 2010 FAO Forestry Resource Assessment: "land spanning more than 0.5 ha with trees higher than 5 metres and canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ . It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use." - FAO.  2010. Global forest resources assessment 2010, Main report, FAO Forestry Paper 163. Rome.

def: "A material accumulation process during which the mass of snow on a surface increases." [https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736]
comment: This term is used both as a process and as an amount of mass added. Semantically speaking these are two distinct concepts (e.g., accumulation results in accumulation_amount of ice or snow gain), though accumulation_amount would more likely be an attribute.\n\nThe scope of this term varies depending on the definition.  Some definitions constrain themselves snow or ice added to glaciers; while others also include ice fields, snow cover, and/or floating ice.  How to resolve this depends on the scope desired.\n\nSome definitions include additional discussion of the the physics involved which would be useful for connecting glacier ontologies to atmospheric, hydrologic, etc. ontologies.  This information should be captured no matter how the inconsistencies above are resolved.

comment: This class refers to Earth's weather fronts. Other forms, not composed of air, are present on other planets and can be created on request. Note: "Since the temperature distribution is the most important regulator of atmospheric density, a front almost invariably separates air masses of different temperature. Along with the basic density criterion and the common temperature criterion, many other features may distinguish a front, such as a pressure trough, a change in wind direction, a moisture discontinuity, and certain characteristic cloud and precipitation forms." {xref="http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Front"}

comment: The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 μm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 4–5 μm, and colloid chemists use 1 μm. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 μm and silt particles as being larger. Mixtures of sand, silt and less than 40% clay are called loam. {xref="Properties"}

When the cause of the convection is unspecified, convection due to the effects of thermal expansion and buoyancy can be assumed. Convection frequently occurs in fluids, but may also take place in soft solids or mixtures where particles can flow. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection"}

comment: The term generally refers to the portions of the Earth where water is in solid form, including snow cover, floating ice, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, seasonally frozen ground and perennially frozen ground (permafrost). The Cryosphere may be divided into the cryoatmosphere, the cryohydrosphere (snow cover, glaciers, and river, lake and sea Ice) and the cryolithosphere (perennially and seasonally cryotic ground, rock glacier). Some definitions consider the cryosphere to include any area of Earth which is sufficiently cold for pure water to freeze for at least a part of each year. It should be noted that "Some authorities exclude the earth's atmosphere from the Earth's Cryosphere; others restrict the term Cryosphere to the regions of the earth's crust where Permafrost exists."\n\nDefinitions of Cryosphere come from several glossaries including:\n- PhysicalGeography.net http://physicalgeography.net/\n-  van Everdingen, Robert, ed., 2005 (1998 revised May 2005).

def: "A sequence feature (continuous extent of biological sequence) that is of genomic origin (i.e. carries sequence from the genome of a cell or organism)" []
comment: 1. A feature being 'of genomic origin' here means only that its sequence has been located to the genome of some organism by alignment with some reference genome. This is because the sequence was originally identified in, or artificially created to replicate, sequence from an organism's genome. \n\n2. The location of a genomic feature is defined by start and end coordinates based on alignment with a reference genome. Genomic features can span any size from a complete chromosome, to a chromosomal band or region, to a gene, to a single base pair or even junction between base pairs (this would be a sequence feature with an extent of zero). \n\n3. As sequence features, instances of genomic features are identified by both their inherent *sequence* and their *position* in a genome - as determined by an alignment with some reference sequence. Accordingly, the 'ATG' start codon in the coding DNA sequence of the human AKT gene and the 'ATG' start codon in the human SHH gene represent two distinct genomic features despite having he same sequence, in virtue of their different positions in the genome.

def: "A specification of the genetic state of an organism, whether complete (defined over the whole genome) or incomplete (defined over a subset of the genome). Genotypes typically describe this genetic state as a diff between some variant component and a canonical reference." []
comment: 1. Scope of 'Genetic State': \n'Genetic state' is considered quite broadly in GENO to describe two general kinds of 'states'.  First, is traditional notion of 'allelic state' - defined as the complement of alleles present at a particular location or locations in a genome (i.e. across all homologous chromosomes containing this location). Here, a genotype can describe allelic state at a specific locus in a genome (an 'allelic genotype'), or describe the allelic state across the entire genome ('genomic genotype'). Second, this concept can also describe states of genomic features 'extrinsic' to their intrinsic sequence, such as the expression status of a gene as a result of being specifically targeted by experimental interventions such as RNAi, morpholinos, or CRISPRs.\n\n2. Genotype Subtypes:\nIn GENO, we use the term 'intrinsic' for genotypes describing variation in genomic sequence, and 'extrinsic' for genotypes describing variation in gene expression (e.g. resulting from the targeted experimental knock-down or over-expression of endogenous genes).  We use the term 'effective genotype' to describe the total intrinsic and extrinsic variation in a cell or organism at the time a phenotypic assessment is performed. \n\nTwo more precise conccepts are subsumed by the notion of an 'intrinsic genotype': (1) 'allelic genotypes', which specify allelic state at a single genomic location; and (2) 'genomic genotypes', which specify allelic state across an entire genome.  In both cases, allelic state is typically specified in terms of a differential between a reference and a set of 1 or more known variant features.\n\n3. The Genotype Partonomy: \n'Genomic genotypes' describing sequence variation across an entire genome are 'decomposed' in GENO into a partonomy  of more granular levels of variation. These levels are defined to be meaningful to biologists in their attempts to relate genetic variation to phenotypic features. They include 'genomic variation complement' (GVC), 'variant single locus complement' (VSLC), 'allele', 'haplotype', 'sequence alteration', and 'genomic background' classes.  For example, the components of the zebrafish genotype "fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a>; fgf3<t24149/+>[AB]", described at  zfin.org/ZDB-FISH-150901-9362, include the following elements:\n\n - GVC: fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a>; fgf3<t24149/+> (total intrinsic variation in the genome)\n - Genomic Background: AB (the reference against which the GVC is variant)\n - VSLC1:  fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a> (homozygous complement of gene alleles at one known variant locus)\n - VSLC2:  fgf3<t24149/+> (heterozygous complement of gene alleles at another known variant locus)\n - Allele 1:  fgf8a<ti282a>   (variant version of the fgf8a gene, present in two copies)\n - Allele 2:  fgf3<t24149>    (variant version of the fgf3 gene, present in one copy)\n - Allele 3:   fgf3<+>    (wild-type version of the fgf3 gene, present in one copy)\n - Sequence Alteration1: <ti282a>  (the specific mutation within the fgf8a gene that makes it variant)\n - Sequence Alteration2: <t24149> (the specific mutation within the fgf3 gene that makes it variant)\n\nA graphical representation of this decomposition that maps each element to a visual depiction of the portion of a genome it denotes can be found here: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/GENO-ontology/blob/develop/README.md\n\nOne reason that explicit representation of these levels is important is because it is at these levels that phenotypic features are annotated to genetic variations in different clinical and model organism databases For example, ZFIN typically annotates phenotypes to effective genotypes, MGI to intrinsic genotypes, Wormbase to variant alleles, and ClinVar to haplotypes and sequence alterations. The ability to decompose a genotype into representations at these levels allows us to "propagate phenotypes" up or down the partonomy (e.g. infer associations of phenotypes annotated to a genotype to its more granular levels of variation and the gene(s) affected). This helps to supporting integrated analysis of G2P data.

property_value: IAO:0000116 "As information artifacts, genotypes specify the state of a genome be defining a diff between some canonical reference and a variant or alternate sequence that replaces the corresponding portion of the reference. We can consider a genotype then as a collection of these reference and variant features, along with some rule for operating on them and resolve a final single sequence. This is valid ontologically because we commit only to sequence features being GDCs - which allows for their concretization in either biological or informational patterns. Accordingly, a particular gene allele, such as shh<tbx292>, can be part of a genome in a biological sense and part of a genotype in an informational sense.

Sets may also include duplicates (i.e. contain more than one member representing the same feature).\n\nThe notion of a 'complement' is a special case of a set, where the members necessarily comprise an exhaustive collection of all objects that make up some well-defined set. It is useful for defining many biologically-relevant sets of sequence features. For example, a 'haplotype' is the set of all genetically-linked alleles on a single chromosomal strand at a defined location - e.g. the SNP alleles \{rs7412-C, rs429358-C\} comprise the haplotype defining the APOEɛ4 gene allele [1]. And a 'single locus complement' is the set of all alleles at a specified location in a particular genome  - e.g. the APOEɛ4 and APOEɛ4 gene alleles ([1], [2]) that make up the 'Gs270' APOE genotype [3].\n\n[1] https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/APOE-%CE%B54\n[2] https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/APOE-%CE%B52\n[3] https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Gs270

comment: A genomic feature is any located sequence feature in the genome, from a single nucleotide to a gene into an entire chromosome. 'Sets' are used to represent entities that are typically collections of more than one member - e.g. the set of chromosomes that make up the human genome. But we allow for sets that contain 0 members (an 'empty' set) or 1 member (a 'singleton' or 'unit' set), consistent with the concept of 'mathematical sets'. For example, a 'single locus complement' at an X-linked locus in a XY male will consist of only one allele, as there is only one X-chromosome in the genome. Note also that sets may contain duplicates (i.e. more than one member representing the same feature). For example, a homozygous 'single locus complement' is a set comprised of two of the same feature.\n\nThe notion of a 'genomic feature set' differs from that of a 'genomic sequence set' in that we are counting how many copies of the same *sequence feature* exist in a genome, as opposed to how many of the same *sequence*. 'Genomic feature sets are useful for representing things like 'single locus complements', where members are sequence features whose identity is dependent on their location. By contrast, 'genomic sequence sets' are useful for describing things like 'copy number complements', which are concerned only with how many copies of a sequence exist in a genome, regardless of the location where these reside.

Accordingly, the 'ATG' translational start codon of the human AKT gene is the same *sequence* as the 'ATG' start codon of the human SHH gene, but these represent two distinct *sequence features* in virtue of their different positions in the genome.

comment: 1. A genomic location (aka locus) is defined by its begin and end coordinates on a reference genome, independent of a particular sequence that may reside there.  In GENO, we say that a genomic location is occupied_by a 'sequence feature' - where the identity of this feature depends on both it sequence, and its location in the genome (i.e. the locus it occupies).  For example, the 'ATG' sequence beginning the ORF of the human SHH gene shares the *same sequence* as the 'ATG' beginning the ORF of the human AKT gene. But these are *distinct sequence features* because they occupy different genomic locations. \n	\n2. A given genomic location (e.g. the human SHH gene locus) may be occupied by different alleles (e.g. different alleles of the SHH gene). Within the genome of a single diploid organism, there is potential for two alleles to exist at such a locus (i.e. two different versions of the SHH gene).  And across genomes of all members of a species, many more alleles of the SHH gene may exist and occupy this same locus.\n\n3. The notion of a genomic location in the realm of biological sequences is analogous to a BFO:spatiotemporal region in the realm of physical entities. A spatiotemporal region can be occupied_by physical objects, while a genomic location is occupied_by sequence features. Just as a spatiotemporal region is distinct from an object that occupies it, so too a genomic locus is distinct from a sequence feature that occupies it.  As a more concrete example, consider the distinction between a street address and the building that occupies it as analogous to the relationship between a genomic location and the feature that resides there.

We will work to resolve these questions and ideally converge these concepts in the future.\n\nWe don't link a Genomic Location to a specific reference sequence because in the FALDO model (which GENO adopts with the exception of swapping GENO:Genomic Locus for FALDO:Region), allows the start and end positions of a region to be defined on separate reference sequences.

comment: Modeling sequence entities at this 'qualified' level is useful for distinguishing cases where features with identical sequence and position as separate instances - based on their material bearers being found in different contexts. For example, consider a situation where the zebrafish shha gene (a sequence feature) is targeted in two experimental groups of fish by two different morpholinos, and phenotypes are assessed for each.  We want to be able to represent two 'variants' of the shha gene in this scenario as separate 'qualified sequence feature' instances so we can capture data about the phenotypes resulting from each - just as we would separately represent to different sequence variants (alleles) of the shha gene at the sequence feature level so that we can track their associated phenotypes.

It leaves open if an organization is a material entity or a dependent continuant, as no consensus was reached on that.  The current placement as material is therefore temporary, in order to move forward with development. Here is the entire email summary, on which the definition is based:\n\n1) there are organization_member_roles (president, treasurer, branch\neditor), with individual persons as bearers\n\n2) there are organization_roles (employer, owner, vendor, patent holder)\n\n3) an organization has a charter / rules / bylaws, which specify what roles\nthere are, how they should be realized, and how to modify the\ncharter/rules/bylaws themselves.\n\nIt is debatable what the organization itself is (some kind of dependent\ncontinuant or an aggregate of people). This also determines who/what the\nbearer of organization_roles' are. My personal favorite is still to define\norganization as a kind of 'legal entity', but thinking it through leads to\nall kinds of questions that are clearly outside the scope of OBI.\n\nInterestingly enough, it does not seem to matter much where we place\norganization itself, as long as we can subclass it (University, Corporation,\nGovernment Agency, Hospital), instantiate it (Affymetrix, NCBI, NIH, ISO,\nW3C, University of Oklahoma), and have it play roles.\n\nThis leads to my proposal: We define organization through the statements 1 -\n3 above, but without an 'is a' statement for now. We can leave it in its\ncurrent place in the is_a hierarchy (material entity) or move it up to\n'continuant'. We leave further clarifications to BFO, and close this issue\nfor now." xsd:string

property_value: IAO:0000116 "2012-12-17 JAO: In common lab usage, there is a distinction made between devices and reagents that is difficult to model. Therefore we have chosen to specifically exclude reagents from the definition of \"device\", and are enumerating the types of roles that a reagent can perform.\n\n2013-6-5 MHB: The following clarifications are outcomes of the May 2013 Philly Workshop. Reagents are distinguished from devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during the realization of their experimental role. By contrast, devices do not participate in such chemical reactions/interactions.  Note that there are cases where devices use reagent components during their operation, where the reagent-device distinction is less clear.  For example:\n\n(1) An HPLC machine is considered a device, but has a column that holds a stationary phase resin as an operational component.  This resin qualifies as a device if it participates purely in size exclusion, but bears a reagent role that is realized in the running of a column if it interacts electrostatically or chemically with the evaluant. The container the resin is in (“the column”) considered alone is a device. So the entire column as well as the entire HPLC machine are devices that have a reagent as an operating part.\n\n(2) A pH meter is a device, but its electrode component bears a reagent role in virtue of its interacting directly with the evaluant in execution of an assay.\n\n(3) A gel running  box  is a device that has a metallic lead as a component that participates in a chemical reaction with the running buffer when a charge is passed through it.  This metallic lead is considered to have a reagent role as a component of this device realized in the running of a gel.\n\nIn the examples above, a reagent is an operational component of a device, but the device itself does not realize a reagent role (as bearing a reagent role is not transitive across the part_of relation).  In this way, the asserted disjointness between a reagent and device holds, as both roles are never realized in the same bearer during execution of an assay." xsd:string

def: "A k-means clustering is a data transformation which achieves a class discovery or partitioning objective, which takes as input a collection of objects (represented as points in multidimensional space) and which partitions them into a specified number k of clusters. The algorithm attempts to find the centers of natural clusters in the data. The most common form of the algorithm starts by partitioning the input points into k initial sets, either at random or using some heuristic data. It then calculates the mean point, or centroid, of each set. It constructs a new partition by associating each point with the closest centroid. Then the centroids are recalculated for the new clusters, and the algorithm repeated by alternate applications of these two steps until convergence, which is obtained when the points no longer switch clusters (or alternatively centroids are no longer changed)."

comment: It is sometimes difficult to define the physical boundaries of a population. In the case of sexually reproducing organisms, the individuals within a population have the potential to reproduce with one another during the course of their lifetimes. 'Community', as often used to describe a group of humans, is a type of population of organisms. \n\nClasses for population already  exist in IDO ('organism population', IDO_0000509) and OBI ('population', OBI_0000181). The definitions should be standardized across OBO Foundry ontologies and only one term used.

comment: Ecological community is defined broadly here, but includes both ecological interactions (inherited from parent term community) and spatial co-existence. It may be used to describe every organisms living in an area, but is often used to refer only to organisms of a particular taxon or guild (e.g., the plant community, the insect community, the herbivore community). The word community, as it often used to describe a group of humans living together, is a type of single-species collection of organisms, not an ecological community.

comment: Roots function in the absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, anchoring the plant body to the substrate and supporting it, storage of food and nutrients, and vegetative reproduction. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with soil-borne microorganisms. Roots are usually positively geotropic and found underground, although there are many exceptions such as the aerial roots of orchids. Roots often form secondary thickening from the root lateral meristem (PO:0006308). Commonly thought of as one of the three basic parts of the plant body, along with the shoot axis (PO:0025029) and leaves (PO:0025034).

This characteristic can lead to more localized and potentially more damaging effects on cells and tissues.\n\nEnhanced Biological Effectiveness: Due to its high LET, heavy ion radiation in many cases has enhanced biological effectiveness, meaning it can cause more severe biological damage per unit of absorbed dose compared to other types of radiation.\n\nSpace Radiation: Heavy ions are a component of the galactic cosmic radiation present in space.\n\nIn common use, the distinction between heavy ions and light ions is somewhat flexible and context dependent. For example, \"heavy\" is sometimes used to refer to any ion heavier than a helium nucleus or even a proton; in practice the dividing line between light and heavy lies around atomic numbers 6-10." xsd:string

The quality of control inhering in the sample role exists as a result of the historical treatment of the sample. In a controlled experiment, two or more virtually identical experiments are conducted, but the factor being tested is varied in only one of them. This serves to isolate any causal phenomena. A control may have been subject to treatments during the experiment that might alter its state or behaviour and is therefore distinguishable from the sample as initial input into the experiment. However such treatments should in all cases but that of the variable under scrutiny, be the same as the experimental sample." []

comment: A sequence feature is an extent of 'located' biological sequence, whose identity is determined by both its inherent sequence (ordering of monomeric units) and its position (start and end coordinates based on alignment with some reference). By contrast, 'biological sequences' are identified and distinguished only by their inehrent sequence, and not their position.  Accordingly, the 'ATG' start codon in the coding DNA sequence of the human AKT gene is the same 'sequence' as the 'ATG' start codon in the human SHH gene, but these represent two distinct 'sequence features' in virtue of their different positions in the genome.

'Qualified sequence feature' identity is additionally dependent on some aspect of the physical context of the genetic material in which the feature is concretized. This third criteria is extrinsic to its sequence and its genomic location. For example, the feature's physical concretization being targeted by a gene knockdown reagent in a cell (e.g. the zebrafish Shha gene as targeted by the morpholino 'Shha-MO1'), or its being transiently expressed from a recombinant expression construct (e.g. the human SHH gene as expressed in a  mouse Shh knock-out cell line), or its having been epigenetically modified in a way that alters its expression level or pattern (e.g. the human SHH gene with a specific methylation pattern)." xsd:string

comment: A genome is considered the complement of all heritable sequence features in a given cell or organism (chromosomal or extrachromosomal). This is typically a collection of >1 sequence molecules (e.g. chromosomes), but in some organisms (e.g. bacteria) it may be a single sequence macromolecule (e.g. a circular plasmid).

def: "Anatomical surface structure found in many aquatic organisms. It is a respiration organ whose function is the extraction of oxygen from water and the excretion of carbon dioxide. The microscopic structure of a gill is such that it presents a very large surface area to the external environment. Gills usually consist of thin filaments of tissue, branches, or slender tufted processes which have a highly folded surface to increase surface area. A high surface area is crucial to the gas exchange of aquatic organisms as water contains only 1/20 parts dissolved Oxygen compared to air. With the exception of some aquatic insects, the filaments and lamellae (folds) contain blood or coelomic fluid, from which gases are exchanged through the thin walls. Oxygen is carried by the blood to other parts of the body. Carbon dioxide passes from the blood through the thin gill tissue into the water. Gills or gill-like organs, located in different parts of the body, are found in various groups of aquatic animals, including mollusks, crustaceans, insects, fish, and amphibians." []

The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string

def: "A specification of the genetic state of an organism, whether complete (defined over the whole genome) or incomplete (defined over a subset of the genome). Genotypes typically describe this genetic state as a diff between some variant component and a canonical reference." []
comment: 1. Scope of 'Genetic State': \n'Genetic state' is considered quite broadly in GENO to describe two general kinds of 'states'.  First, is traditional notion of 'allelic state' - defined as the complement of alleles present at a particular location or locations in a genome (i.e. across all homologous chromosomes containing this location). Here, a genotype can describe allelic state at a specific locus in a genome (an 'allelic genotype'), or describe the allelic state across the entire genome ('genomic genotype'). Second, this concept can also describe states of genomic features 'extrinsic' to their intrinsic sequence, such as the expression status of a gene as a result of being specifically targeted by experimental interventions such as RNAi, morpholinos, or CRISPRs.\n\n2. Genotype Subtypes:\nIn GENO, we use the term 'intrinsic' for genotypes describing variation in genomic sequence, and 'extrinsic' for genotypes describing variation in gene expression (e.g. resulting from the targeted experimental knock-down or over-expression of endogenous genes).  We use the term 'effective genotype' to describe the total intrinsic and extrinsic variation in a cell or organism at the time a phenotypic assessment is performed. \n\nTwo more precise conccepts are subsumed by the notion of an 'intrinsic genotype': (1) 'allelic genotypes', which specify allelic state at a single genomic location; and (2) 'genomic genotypes', which specify allelic state across an entire genome.  In both cases, allelic state is typically specified in terms of a differential between a reference and a set of 1 or more known variant features.\n\n3. The Genotype Partonomy: \n'Genomic genotypes' describing sequence variation across an entire genome are 'decomposed' in GENO into a partonomy  of more granular levels of variation. These levels are defined to be meaningful to biologists in their attempts to relate genetic variation to phenotypic features. They include 'genomic variation complement' (GVC), 'variant single locus complement' (VSLC), 'allele', 'haplotype', 'sequence alteration', and 'genomic background' classes.  For example, the components of the zebrafish genotype "fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a>; fgf3<t24149/+>[AB]", described at  zfin.org/ZDB-FISH-150901-9362, include the following elements:\n\n - GVC: fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a>; fgf3<t24149/+> (total intrinsic variation in the genome)\n - Genomic Background: AB (the reference against which the GVC is variant)\n - VSLC1:  fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a> (homozygous complement of gene alleles at one known variant locus)\n - VSLC2:  fgf3<t24149/+> (heterozygous complement of gene alleles at another known variant locus)\n - Allele 1:  fgf8a<ti282a>   (variant version of the fgf8a gene, present in two copies)\n - Allele 2:  fgf3<t24149>    (variant version of the fgf3 gene, present in one copy)\n - Allele 3:   fgf3<+>    (wild-type version of the fgf3 gene, present in one copy)\n - Sequence Alteration1: <ti282a>  (the specific mutation within the fgf8a gene that makes it variant)\n - Sequence Alteration2: <t24149> (the specific mutation within the fgf3 gene that makes it variant)\n\nA graphical representation of this decomposition that maps each element to a visual depiction of the portion of a genome it denotes can be found here: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/GENO-ontology/blob/develop/README.md\n\nOne reason that explicit representation of these levels is important is because it is at these levels that phenotypic features are annotated to genetic variations in different clinical and model organism databases For example, ZFIN typically annotates phenotypes to effective genotypes, MGI to intrinsic genotypes, Wormbase to variant alleles, and ClinVar to haplotypes and sequence alterations. The ability to decompose a genotype into representations at these levels allows us to "propagate phenotypes" up or down the partonomy (e.g. infer associations of phenotypes annotated to a genotype to its more granular levels of variation and the gene(s) affected). This helps to supporting integrated analysis of G2P data.
property_value: IAO:0000116 "As information artifacts, genotypes specify the state of a genome be defining a diff between some canonical reference and a variant or alternate sequence that replaces the corresponding portion of the reference. We can consider a genotype then as a collection of these reference and variant features, along with some rule for operating on them and resolve a final single sequence. This is valid ontologically because we commit only to sequence features being GDCs - which allows for their concretization in either biological or informational patterns. Accordingly, a particular gene allele, such as shh<tbx292>, can be part of a genome in a biological sense and part of a genotype in an informational sense. This idea underpins the 'genotype partonomy' at the core of the GENO model that decomposes a complete genotype into its more fundamental parts, including alleles and allele complements, as described in the comment above." xsd:string

comment: In GENO we define three levels of sequence artifacts: (1) biological sequences, (2) sequence features, and (3) qualified sequence features. The identify criteria for a 'biological sequence' include only its inherent sequence (the ordered string of units that comprise it). The identity criteria for a 'sequence feature' include its sequence and position (where it resides - i.e. its location based on how it maps to a reference or standard) The identity criteria for a 'qualified sequence feature' include its component sequence feature (defined by its sequence and position), and the material context of its bearer in a cell or organism. This context can include direct epigenetic modification, or being targeted by gene knockdown reagents such as morpholinos or RNAi, or being transiently overexpressed from a transgenic construct in a cell or organism.

comment: Note that this relation was previously called "inheres in", but was changed to be called "characteristic of" because BFO2 uses "inheres in" in a more restricted fashion. This relation differs from BFO2:inheres_in in two respects: (1) it does not impose a range constraint, and thus it allows qualities of processes, as well as of information entities, whereas BFO2 restricts inheres_in to only apply to independent continuants (2) it is declared functional, i.e. something can only be a characteristic of one thing.

def: "relation that links two events, processes, states, or objects such that one event, process, state, or object (a cause) contributes to the production of another event, process, state, or object (an effect) where the cause is partly or wholly responsible for the effect, and the effect is partly or wholly dependent on the cause." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality]
property_value: IAO:0000116 "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative?\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string
