obo:SLSO_1000001	Aquarius	'research station'		"An underwater habitat and research laboratory deployed on the ocean floor at a depth of 62 feet/19 meters and located 3.5 miles/6.5 km from Key Largo, FL.  The installation consists of a surface-level life support buoy, the 45ft/14m x 9.8ft/3m habitat with living quarters, life-support systems, and laboratory space, and two underwater waystations supplying air for aquanauts on extended dives outside the habitat.  The habitat includes a wet entry porch, a pressurizable main cabin, and a sealable entry lock connecting the two pressure zones.  Saturation diving allows crews of up to six people to conduct extended missions while living in the habitat.  Aquarius enables spaceflight analog studies approximating extreme space environments, extravehicular activity, and isolation and confinement of crew.

It is a multi-compartment, pressurized facility that is used to capture subjects' emotional and mental state in long-duration isolated and confined environment to advance understanding of behavioral risks associated with this type of spaceflight analog. Subjects are physically isolated and have limited communication to the outside world. This enables subjects to feel as if they are in an actual spaceflight environment. The two areas of study are behavioral health and biochemistry, which will monitor subjects’ psychological health and cortisol levels, respectively."

Subjects’ emotional and mental states in a short-duration, isolated, and confined environment are captured to advance understanding of behavioral risks associated with this type of spaceflight analog. The two areas of study are behavioral health and biochemistry, which monitor subjects’ psychological health and cortisol levels, respectively. "
